In the future, there are several areas that can be explored to enhance the project. 

One aspect is integrating with different datasets. Another possibility for improvement is the classification of different types of EEG data, such as P300 or other Event-Related Potentials. More data augmentation techniques and exploring different SMOTE implementations are also on the table.
