- **Artifact Removal**: Elimination of artifacts from electrode placement errors, body motions, and ambient noise.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring all electrodes contribute equally to the final result through normalization.
- **Filtering**: Application of filters to the EEG data to isolate relevant signal frequencies.
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Use of FFT for frequency domain analysis, combined with oversampling techniques.
- **EEG Channel Selection**: Reduction of data complexity by selecting the most informative EEG channels.
- **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**: Balancing class distribution by creating synthetic data points similar to the minority classes.
